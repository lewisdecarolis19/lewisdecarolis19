<h2>GIS Projects 🌎</h2>

 🚧 In Progress 🚧
  

<h2>I'm Currently Learning 🌱</h2>

- GIS!  I am enthusiastic about geography and maps, and I am currently enhancing my knowledge of GIS through ESRI's online courses.  Additionally, I am following along with video tutorials to effectively utilize popular tools such as ArcGIS and QGIS.  My goal is to leverage data to create compelling narratives using maps.  I am making progress on my own GIS projects, and I hope to add them to my portfolio soon.
- I am also continuing to build my knowledge in SQL, Python, and PowerBI.
